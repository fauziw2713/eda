## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA, is an important step in any Data Analysis or Data Science project. EDA is the process of investigating the dataset to discover patterns, and anomalies (outliers), and form hypotheses based on our understanding of the dataset. 
EDA involves generating summary statistics for numerical data in the dataset and creating various graphical representations to understand the data better.
### Importing Libraries
Importing the required libraries for Exploratory Data Analysis (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn)
### Uploading Data Set
Uploading the Titanic.csv from existing location to the google colab
### Reading Data Set
Read the Titanic.csv dataset
### Changing Index
- Pandas default index starts from 0
- While the dataset index of the PassengerId column starts from 1
- Then we will use the index dataset of column PassengerId
